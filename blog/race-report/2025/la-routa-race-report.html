                Race Report: La Routa Adventure Race — ARWS Asia Championship 2025
            </h1>

        <hr>

        <p>
            For years we chased the chance to put Team Dirt on the international stage. Being Filipino athletes in a gear- and time-intensive sport like adventure racing comes with extra hurdles — funding, logistics, experience — but we kept pushing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fate helped: the AR World Series (ARWS) came to the Philippines through La Routa, our homegrown race that’s been running since 2000. We’ve raced La Routa for years (we won the 2019 edition in Tacloban), and when it became an ARWS Asia flagship in 2023 we made a bid for the Asia crown. That attempt didn’t go our way — mainly because we lacked expedition experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since then we worked on what makes an expedition team work: dynamics, strength and endurance, mental toughness, navigation, communication — and above all, experience. After the training, the nights, and the lessons, we’re proud to say: Team Dirt are the AR World Series Asia Champions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below is how the race unfolded for us.
        </p>

        <h3>Team & Preparation</h3>
        <p>
            We came into La Routa fresh from the Samboan Adventure Race, so training tweaks for me, Erika, and Gil were minimal. The bigger task was adding fresh blood: Lilik Velasco. Lilik (20 at the time; he turned 21 during the race) is an XC mountain biker recommended by our friend Dave. This was his first multiday expedition—definitely a risk—but his youth and power showed in training and proved invaluable on course.
        </p>

        <h2>Day 1 — November 18, 2025</h2>
        <p>
            The race flagged off at 9:00 AM from the Capitol Grounds in Naval, Biliran. Our race passports were tied to bamboo poles for the Palo Sebo start. We were clumsy (haha) and left the capitol grounds 10th out of 12 teams.
        </p>

        <h3>TA1 → CP1 (Dalutan Island)</h3>
        <p>
            From TA1 we sprinted to the Naval port for a paddle. Two bancas took us out to Dalutan. Gil and Lilik shared one boat; Erika and I the other. We hugged the coastline to avoid the stronger currents in the Biliran Strait — a conservative line that paid off. The 9 km paddle took about two hours and we checked into CP1 second, having poached several teams with that coastal tactic.
        </p>

        <h3>CP2 (Talahid Beach Resort) — Swim</h3>
        <p>
            From Dalutan we swam ~2 km back to mainland Biliran in choppy conditions. Team Skomad was minutes ahead; catching them would be key. We checked into CP2 a few seconds after them and executed a fast transition into the trek — months of practicing quick transitions really helped.
        </p>

        <h3>CP3 → CP5 (Mt. Panamao)</h3>
        <p>
            We trekked into the foothills toward CP3. Lunch was on the move; we rarely sat down to eat — that was deliberate. CP4 (Camp Beben) was reached in daylight, so yellow ribbons were easy to follow. The sunset over Maripipi and the grasslands of Camp Beben is a mental picture I still carry.
        </p>

        <p>
            From CP4 we traversed to CP5, just past Mt. Panamao’s summit. By then it was foggy and dark; headlamps went on for the slog to CP6.
        </p>

        <blockquote>

        <p>
            We hit a dead end around a fallen tree and lost about 45 minutes untangling route options. Skomad was nearby and helped point out an alternate line; with their brighter lights we finally found the trail down to the road leading to CP6 (Palayan). We probably lost a good hour — the gap we’d built earlier was gone.
        </p>

        <h3>CP6 (Brgy. Palayan)</h3>
        <p>
            Palayan was bustling with crew and supplies. We ate lechon manok, refilled water, and decided to take a longer rest to prepare for the Tres Marias traverse — a section I hadn’t realized would be a full traverse when I first plotted the map.

        </p>

        <h3>Tres Marias (CP7 → CP8)</h3>
        <p>
            Trekking with Skomad through Tres Marias was cordial — we shared navigation tips and trail warnings. CP7 near Tres Marias Peak 1 was straightforward. CP8 at Ulan Ulan Falls came after about four hours of trekking; it was midnight. We celebrated Lilik’s birthday (he’d hidden fudgee bars as a makeshift cake) and set up for a night abseil beside the waterfall — an amazing, cold, wet experience (I slipped and got doused by the falls). We finished the abseil around 12:45 AM and rolled into Day 2.
