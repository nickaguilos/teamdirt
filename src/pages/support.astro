            <h2 class="fw-bold">Why this matters</h2>
            <p>
                Qualifying for the Adventure Racing World Championships is the result of years of consistent training, racing, and community building. Representing the Philippines at ARWC France is not just a race goal — it’s a chance to show what Filipino athletes and grassroots communities can achieve on the global stage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Partnership support directly enables our preparation, logistics, and race execution for this campaign.
