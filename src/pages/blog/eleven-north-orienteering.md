<p class="lead">
    The 11° North Orienteering Championships was built around a simple idea:
    <i>navigation matters.</i>
    In recent years, many races have leaned heavily toward speed, fitness, or familiarity with terrain. At 11° North, we want to slow things down just enough to reward teams who can think clearly while moving fast—teams who can read a map under pressure, make good decisions when tired, and work together when the terrain roughens up.


***

### Everyone Starts Equal

There are no pre-declared elite entries at 11° North.

Every team—whether experienced or new—starts from the same line, with the same map, under the same conditions. From there, it’s execution that decides where you end up.

The race format is intentionally designed to let performance speak for itself. If you belong in the Elite field, the course will make that clear. If you’re still building experience, the race will meet you where you are—without cutting corners on fairness or challenge.


***

### Why Tandem Teams Only


This year, all teams are two-person teams. No solo entries.

Orienteering, at its core, is about decision-making under uncertainty. Doing that well requires communication, trust, and shared responsibility. Tandem teams force that dynamic to the surface.

You don’t just navigate for yourself—you navigate for each other.

Teams may be men’s, women’s, or mixed, but the rule is the same: you move together, you decide together, and you finish together.

### Navigation Comes First

At 11° North, navigation is not merely a discipline—it is the whole point of the race.

Only the official race map may be used. GPS navigation and digital maps are not allowed. Compass work, terrain reading, and smart route choices are essential.


***


### Safety, Respect, and Responsibility


This race takes place in real terrain, with real consequences.

Teams are expected to:

<ul>
    <li>Look after each other</li>
    <li>Respect race marshals and local communities</li>
    <li>Leave the course as they found it</li>
</ul>


Cut-off times are enforced. Safety calls by officials are final. These rules exist not to limit competition, but to make sure the race remains fair—and that everyone gets home.

### Racing With Purpose


11° North is not about proving who is the fastest on Strava, or who has raced the most events.



It’s about:


<ul>
<li>Reading the map when your legs are tired</li>
<li>Trusting your teammate when you’re unsure</li>
<li>Making decisions you can stand by at the finish line</li>
</ul>
